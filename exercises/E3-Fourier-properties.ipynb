    "# Exercise 3: Fourier properties\n",
    "\n",
    "With this exercise you will get a better understanding of some of the Fourier theorems and of some useful properties of the DFT. You will write code to implement and verify several properties of the DFT that are discussed in the lectures. You will also learn to use the `dftModel.py` module of sms-tools, which contains the basic python functions implementing the DFT. There are five parts in the exercise: 1) Minimize energy spread in DFT of sinusoids, 2) Symmetry properties of the DFT, 3) Suppressing frequency components using DFT model, and 4) FFT size and zero-padding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevant Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "__DFT of sinusoids:__ When a real sinusoid has an integer number of cycles in $N$ samples, the frequency of the sinusoid exactly matches one of the bin frequencies in an $N$ point DFT. Hence the DFT spectrum of the sinusoid has a value of zero at every DFT bin except at the two bins that match the frequency of the sinusoid. Otherwise, the energy of the sinusoid is spread over all the bins. When there are multiple sinusoids, the equations extend to each sinusoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    " x[n]&=&A_{0}\\cos\\left(2\\pi k_{0}n/N\\right)=\\frac{A_{0}}{2}{\\textstyle e}^{j2\\pi k_{0}n/N}+\\frac{A_{0}}{2}{\\textstyle e}^{-j2\\pi k_{0}n/N}\\\\\n",
    " X[k] &=& \\frac{A_0}{2} \\,\\,\\, \\mathrm{for} \\,\\,\\, k = k_0, -k_0; \\,\\,\\,\\, 0 \\,\\,\\,\\mathrm{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "__Zero-padding:__ Zero-padding a signal is done by adding zeros at the end of the signal. If we perform zero-padding to a signal before computing its DFT, the resulting spectrum will be an interpolated version of the spectrum of the original signal.  In most implementations of the DFT (including the FFT algorithms) when the DFT size is larger than the length of the signal, zero-padding is implicitly done.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Zero phase windowing:__ Zero phase windowing of a frame of a signal puts the centre of the signal at the zero time index for DFT computation. By moving the centre of the frame to zero index by a circular shift, the computed DFT will not have the phase offset which would have otherwise been introduced (recall that a shift of the signal causes the DFT to be multiplied by a complex exponential, which keeps the magnitude spectrum intact but changes the phase spectrum). When used in conjunction with zero-padding, zero phase windowing is also useful for the creation of a frame of length of power of 2 for FFT computation (`fftbuffer`).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the length of the signal $x$ is $M$ and the required DFT size is $N$, the zero phase windowed version of the signal, `dftbuffer`, for DFT computation can be obtained by (works for both even and odd $M$):\n",
    "\n",
    "    hM1 = floor((M+1)/2)\n",
    "    hM2 = floor(M/2)\n",
    "    dftbuffer = zeros(N)\n",
    "    dftbuffer[:hM1] = x[hM2:]\n",
    "    dftbuffer[-hM2:] = x[:hM2]\n",
    "\n",
    "__Real, even and odd signals:__ A signal is real when it does not have any imaginary component, and all sounds are real signals. A signal $x$ is even if $x[n] = x[-n]$, and odd if $x[n] = -x[-n]$. For a signal of length $M$ (and $M$ is odd), in the context of a zero phase windowed signal and its DFT, the signal is even if $x[n] = x[M-n]$ and odd if $x[n] = -x[M-n]$, $1 \\leq n \\leq M-1$. The DFT properties show that for real input signals, the magnitude spectrum is even and the phase spectrum is odd. Furthermore, when the input signal is both real and even, the DFT is real valued, with an even magnitude spectrum and imaginary component equal to zero. In summary, if $x$ is an input signal of length $M$ ($M$ is odd) and $X = \\mathrm{DFT}(x,M)$, then for $1 \\leq k \\leq M-1$\n",

    "\n",
    "If $x$ is real and even, $\\left|X[k]\\right| = \\left|X[M-k]\\right|$ and $\\mathrm{imag}(X[k]) = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Positive half of the DFT spectrum:__ Audio signals are real signals. Due to the symmetry properties of the DFT of a real signal, it is sufficient to store only one half of the magnitude and phase spectra. To save on both storage and computation, we will just store just the half spectrum when possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "From an $N$ point DFT ($N$ even), we can obtain the positive half of the spectrum by considering only the first $(N/2)+1$ samples of the DFT. We can compute the magnitude spectrum of the positive half (in dB) as $m_X = 20\\log_{10}\\left|X[0:(N/2)+1]\\right|$, where $X$ is the DFT of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Filtering:__ Filtering involves selectively suppressing certain frequencies present in the signal. Filtering is often performed in the time domain by the convolution of the input signal with the impulse response of a filter. The same operation can also be done in the DFT domain using the properties of DFT, by multiplying the DFT of the input signal by the DFT of the impulse response of the filter. In this assignment, we will consider a very simple illustrative filter that suppresses some frequency components by setting some DFT coefficients to zero. It is to be noted that the convolution operation here is circular convolution with a period $N$, the size of the DFT.\n",

    "\n",
    "Given an input signal consisting of two sinusoids, the function `minimize_energy_spread_dft()` should select the first `M` samples from the signal and return the positive half of the DFT magnitude spectrum (in dB), such that it has only two non-zero values.\n",
    "\n",
    "`M` is to be calculated as the smallest positive integer for which the positive half of the DFT magnitude spectrum has only two non-zero values. To get the positive half of the spectrum, first compute the `M` point DFT of the input signal (for this you can use the `fft()` function of `scipy.fftpack`). Consider only the first `(M/2)+1` samples of the DFT, computing the magnitude spectrum of the positive half (in dB) as `mX = 20*log10(abs(X[:M/2+1]))`, where `X` is the DFT of the input signal.\n",

    "The input arguments to this function are the input signal `x` (of length W >= M) consisting of two sinusoids of frequency `f1` and `f2`, the sampling frequency `fs` and the value of frequencies `f1` and `f2`. The function should return the positive half of the magnitude spectrum `mX`. For this question, you can assume the input frequencies `f1` and `f2` to be positive integers and factors of `fs`, and that `M` is even.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the precision of the FFT computation, the zero values of the DFT are not zero but very small values < 1e-12 (or -240 dB) in magnitude. For practical purposes, all values with absolute value less than 1e-6 (or -120 dB) can be considered to be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "HINT: The DFT magnitude spectrum of a sinusoid has only one non-zero value (in the positive half of the DFT spectrum) when its frequency coincides with one of the DFT bin frequencies. This happens when the DFT size (`M` in this question) contains exactly an integer number of periods of the sinusoid. Since the signal in this question consists of two sinusoids, this condition should hold true for each of the sinusoids, so that the DFT magnitude spectrum has only two non-zero values, one per sinusoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "`M` can be computed as the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the sinusoid periods (in samples). The LCM of two numbers `x`, `y` can be computed as: `x*y/gcd(x,y)`, where gcd denotes the greatest common divisor."

You will see that `mag_spectra[2]` is the interpolated version of `mag_spectra[0]` (zero-padding leads to interpolation of the DFT). You will also observe that the 'mainlobe' of the magnitude spectrum in `mag_spectra[1]` will be narrower than that in `mag_spectra[0]` and `mag_spectra[2]`. This shows that having a longer window leads to a narrower mainlobe with better frequency resolution and less spreading of the energy of the sinusoid."
